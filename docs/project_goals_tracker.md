## üìä Metrics & KPIs

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Currently 0% (Target: 80%)
- **API Response Time**: TBD (Target: <200ms)
- **Build Time**: ~30 seconds (Target: <2 minutes)
- **Deployment Time**: TBD (Target: <5 minutes)

### Quality Metrics
- **Bug Count**: 0 reported
- **Technical Debt**: Low
- **Code Review Coverage**: 100%
- **Documentation Coverage**: 60%

---

## üîß Technical Debt

### Current Items
1. **Test Coverage**: No tests written yet
2. **Error Handling**: Basic implementation, needs enhancement
3. **Logging**: Structured logging not fully implemented
4. **Security**: Security headers not configured

### Planned Refactoring
1. Move to microservices architecture (Phase 5)
2. Implement event-driven architecture
3. Add GraphQL support
4. Implement caching strategy

---

## üìù Notes

### Recent Decisions
- Using FastAPI for better async support and automatic API docs
- PostgreSQL chosen for JSONB support and full-text search
- JWT tokens over sessions for stateless architecture
- Docker Compose for local development

### Lessons Learned
1. Environment configuration should be developer-friendly
2. Clear error messages improve developer experience
3. Documentation should be maintained alongside code
4. Incremental development reduces complexity

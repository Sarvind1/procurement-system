# Project Brain: Procurement Management System

## Overview
The Procurement Management System is designed to streamline and automate procurement processes, including user management, product management, inventory tracking, supplier management, purchase order processing, and shipment tracking. This document outlines the thought process, design decisions, and technical details behind the development of this system.

## Architecture
The system is built using a modern, scalable architecture with the following components:

- **Backend**: FastAPI, a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, async support, and easy integration with databases and authentication systems.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source relational database system. It is used for storing all data related to users, products, inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, and shipments.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication. This allows for easy integration with frontend applications and ensures that user sessions are secure and scalable.
- **Migrations**: Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. It is used to manage database schema changes, ensuring that the database structure evolves with the application.
- **Session Management**: Async SQLAlchemy for efficient database interactions. This allows for non-blocking database operations, improving the performance of the application.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**:
  - **FastAPI**: The main application framework.
  - **Models**: Contains models for users, products, inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, and shipments.
  - **API Endpoints**: Includes endpoints for authentication, products, inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, and shipments.
  - **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL with Alembic for migrations.
  - **Session Management**: Async SQLAlchemy for efficient database interactions.

### Key Files
- **`backend/app/main.py`**: The entry point for the FastAPI application.
- **`backend/app/models/`**: Contains SQLAlchemy models for the database.
- **`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`**: Contains API endpoint definitions.
- **`backend/alembic/`**: Contains migration scripts and configuration.
- **`backend/app/db/session.py`**: Manages database sessions.
- **`backend/app/core/`**: Contains core configurations and utilities.
- **`backend/app/schemas/`**: Contains Pydantic schemas for request/response validation.

### Additional Files
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Configuration for Docker services.
- **`Makefile`**: Contains commands for building and running the project.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: The project's license information.

## Design Decisions

### 1. FastAPI
FastAPI was chosen for its performance, ease of use, and automatic API documentation. It allows for rapid development and testing of APIs, making it ideal for a project of this scale.

### 2. PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL was selected for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries. It is well-suited for handling the relational data required by the procurement system.

### 3. JWT Authentication
JWT authentication was implemented to provide a secure and scalable way to manage user sessions. It eliminates the need for server-side session storage, making the system more efficient and easier to scale.

### 4. Alembic Migrations
Alembic was chosen for its ability to manage database schema changes in a controlled and repeatable manner. This ensures that the database structure can evolve with the application without data loss or corruption.

### 5. Async SQLAlchemy
Async SQLAlchemy was used to improve the performance of database operations. By allowing non-blocking database interactions, it ensures that the application can handle a large number of concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Development Process
The development process followed a structured approach:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding the needs of the procurement system and defining the core modules and features.
2. **Design**: Creating the database schema, API endpoints, and authentication system.
3. **Implementation**: Developing the backend using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication.
4. **Testing**: Writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.
5. **Deployment**: Setting up the environment and deploying the application to a production server.

## Future Changes
As the project evolves, the following areas will be considered for future development:

- **Frontend Development**: Building a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend APIs.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Setting up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the system.
- **Scalability**: Enhancing the system to handle increased load and data volume.

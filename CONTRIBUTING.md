## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

### Our Pledge
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Python** 3.11+
- **Docker** and Docker Compose
- **Git** for version control

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/procurement-system.git`
3. Navigate to the project: `cd procurement-system`
4. Follow the setup instructions in [README.md](./README.md)

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
We use a modified GitFlow workflow:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features (`feature/inventory-management`)
- **bugfix/**: Bug fixes (`bugfix/fix-order-calculation`)
- **hotfix/**: Critical production fixes (`hotfix/security-patch`)

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on your feature
# ...

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh functionality

fix(inventory): resolve stock calculation error

docs: update API documentation for purchase orders

test(suppliers): add unit tests for supplier validation
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8
- **Formatter**: Use `black` for code formatting
- **Linter**: Use `pylint` and `flake8`
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions and methods
- **Imports**: Use `isort` for import organization

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Run linters
pylint app/
flake8 app/

# Type checking
mypy app/
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- **Style Guide**: Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- **Formatter**: Use `prettier` for code formatting
- **Linter**: Use `eslint` with TypeScript rules
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

### General Guidelines
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Write tests for new functionality

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% code coverage
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_auth.py
```

### Frontend Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% code coverage
- **Test Types**: Unit, component, and integration tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test
npm run test -- auth.test.ts
```

### Test Guidelines
- Write tests before or alongside feature development (TDD/BDD)
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests isolated and independent

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Sync with latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase develop
   ```

2. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && poetry run pytest
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run test
   ```

3. **Check code quality**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   black . && isort . && pylint app/ && mypy app/
   
   # Frontend
   npm run lint && npm run type-check
   ```
